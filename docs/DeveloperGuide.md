### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `CalendarDisplay` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a `CommandHistory` object that represents the user’s command history. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyCommandHistory` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* can save command history data in text format and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage` and `CommandHistoryStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Appointment feature

This feature represents an appointment between a user and a client. An appointment consists of a DateTime and a Location.

Overview of implementation for Appointment:

* `Appointment`- This is a class that stores information regarding an appointment of a specific client, such as the `DateTime` and `Location`.
* `DateTime`- This is a class that stores the Date and Time of an `Appointment`. It has a format of `d-MMM-yyyy hh:mm a` as a `String`.
* `Location`- This is a class that stores the location of an `Appointment`. It can take any `String` values, but it must not be blank.
* `JsonAdaptedAppointment`- This is a class that acts as a bridge between the `Appointment` class and `Storage` layer. It specifies how an `Appointment` object is converted to a JSON and vice versa.
* `AddAppointmentCommandParser`- This is a class that parses user input from a `String` to an `AddAppointmentCommand` object. Validation for the user's input is performed in this class.
* `AddAppointmentCommand`- This is a class where the logic for the Add Appointment command is specified and the `execute` method is called. It will access the `Model` layer to ensure that there will not be a duplicate `Appointment` and the maximum number of `Appointments` for the client has not been reached, followed by adding the `Appointment` to the `Model`.
* `MaximumSortedList`- This is an abstraction that represents the list of `Appointments` for a specific client. It ensures that the `Appointments` are in sorted order according to chronological order, ensures that there is a maximum number, 3, of `Appointments` for each client and ensures that there are no duplicate `Appointments` for each client.

The appointment feature currently supports 3 different commands.
1. `add appointment`
2. `edit appointment`
3. `delete appointment`

#### Add Appointment Command

Step 1. When the user inputs an appropriate command `String` into the `CommandBox`, `LogicManager##execute(commandText)` is called. The command `String` is logged and then passed to `AddressBookParser##parseCommand(userInput)` which parses the command.
Step 2. If the user input matches the format for the command word for the `AddAppointmentCommand`, `AddressBookParser` will create an `AddAppointmentCommandParser` and will call the `AddAppointmentCommandParser##parse(args)` to parse the command.
Step 3. Validation for the user input is performed, such as validating the client's `Index`, the format of the `DateTime` and `Location`.
Step 4. If the user input is valid, a new `AddAppointmentCommand` object is created and returned to the `LogicManager`.
Step 5. `LogicManager` will call `AddAppointmentCommand##execute(model)` method. Further validation is performed, such as checking whether a duplicate `Appointment` exists and whether the user has already scheduled the maximum number, 3, of `Appointments` for the specified client.
Step 6. If the command is valid, the `add` method of the `MaximumSortedList` containing the client's `Appointments` is called, which will update the `Person` and `Model`.
Step 7. `AddAppointmentCommand` will create a `CommandResult` object and will return this created object back to `LogicManager`.

This is shown in the diagram below:

![Add Appointment Sequence Diagram](images/AddAppointmentCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<br> *Figure xx: Add Appointment Command Sequence Diagram*

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How many `Appointments` can be added for each command**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add only one `Appointment` in each command.
  * Pros: Simpler input validation and length of user input is shorter, as the presence of multiple `DateTime` and `Location` fields has the potential to be very lengthy
  * Cons: User has to execute the `aa` command multiple times to add all their desired `Appointments`
* **Alternative 2**: Multiple `Appointments` can be added in each command
  * Pros: Lower number of commands needed to be executed to add all the desired `Appointments`
  * Cons: Complex input validation as unique `DateTimes` and `Locations` must be enforced within the command and alongside the existing `Appointments`. The maximum number of `Appointments` must also be enforced. Also, length of user input may be very long


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Filter feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed filter mechanism is facilitated by `FilteredAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with a temporary history, stored internally as an `savedAddressBook`, with a `currentStatePointer` showing if the filtered list or the original list is shown. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `FilteredAddressBook#filter()` — Filters and saves the filtered address book state from the current address book state.
* `FilteredAddressBook#restore()` — Restores and shows the current address book state.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#filterAddressBook()` and `Model#restoreAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `FilteredAddressBook` will be initialized with the current address book state.


Step 2. The user executes `filter LOW` command to show only contacts with risk tag LOW in the address book. The `filter` command calls `Model#filterAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `filter LOW` command executes to be saved in the `savedAddressBook`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the filtered address book state.


The `clear` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#restoreAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` to the current address book state, and restores the address book to that state.



Step 3. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#filterAddressBook()` or `Model#restoreAddressBook()`. Thus, the `savedAddressBook` remains unchanged.



#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How filter executes:**


_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_


### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

#### Parameter hint feature

The feature allows a user to view the correct prefixes and arguments of a command before entering the command.

The parameter hints for the command will be shown in the ResultDisplay once the command word is typed out.

### Calendar features
The calendar feature allows a calendar to display with the corresponding appointments of the month in a calendar format. The feature consists of the following features:
* `Calendar Display` — Can display appointments of a month in a calendar format.
* `Calendar Navigation` — Can navigate between months with/without a mouse.
* `Calendar Pop-Up` — Can view the details of each appointment.

**Calendar Display**

Implementation:

The following is a more detailed explanation on how `Calendar Display` works.
1. When the app first launches, `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()` is called, which then initialises the `Calendar Display`. This then initialises the `CalendarLogic` and the relevant methods to build the the `Calendar Display`.
2. Following which, when appointments are added,`Model#updateCalendarEventList()` is called which then updates the `Calendar Display` as well.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user selects the Calendar tab:
![Calendar Display Activity](images/CalendarDisplayActivityDiagram.png)

**Calendar Navigation**
The Calendar navigation allows a user to navigate between different months in the calendar and also navigate between the different appointments within the current month.
This feature uses JavaFX's FocusModel features to obtain different behaviours when a Ui component is focused.

Implementation:

The following is a more detailed explanation on how `Calendar Navigation` works.
1. Clicking on the Next/Prev buttons to view the next/previous month in the calendar
2. Pressing N or B key to view the next/previous month in the calendar
3. Pressing the ENTER key when the Next/Prev button is focused to view the next/previous month in the calendar
4. Typing the date in the Jump Box and pressing the ENTER key to view the input month and year of the date.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user selects a navigation feature:
![Calendar Navigation Activity](images/CalendarNavigationActivityDiagram.png)
#### Calendar Pop-up
The calendar Pop-up allows user to view the details of the appointment in the calendar

Implementation:

The following is a more detailed explanation on how `Calendar Pop-Up` works.
1. Clicking on the Up/Down/Left/Right keys to view adjacent appointments oriented in space in the calendar
2. Pressing SHIFT or SHIFT + TAB key to view the next/previous appointment in the calendar
3. Clicking on a desired appointment to view the appointment in the calendar

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user selects an appointment in the calendar tab:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of clients
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* requires a secure app to store sensitive client details

**Value proposition**: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app while ensuring that client details are safe and secure.
